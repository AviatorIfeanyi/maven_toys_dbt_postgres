## Maven Toys Data Transformation

This data analysis project gives details on the Sales & Inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys

It also includes information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

Using dbt, we will be able to transform and clean the data in order to make it usable for analysis. 


This project will demonstrate how dbt can prove to be a valuable tool for data cleaning and transformations, enabling analysts to make data-driven business decisions.
